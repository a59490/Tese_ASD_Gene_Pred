GO:BP & GO:0141124 & intracellular signaling cassette & 0.000000 & "An intracellular signaling module that is part of larger signaling pathways that can be initiated either intracellularly or by cell surface receptors. Intracellular signaling cassettes are discrete signaling units that are often shared by multiple signaling pathways." [GOC:ha, GOC:pg] \\

GO:BP & GO:0007165 & signal transduction & 0.000000 & "The cellular process in which a signal is conveyed to trigger a change in the activity or state of a cell. Signal transduction begins with reception of a signal (e.g. a ligand binding to a receptor or receptor activation by a stimulus such as light), or for signal transduction in the absence of ligand, signal-withdrawal or the activity of a constitutively active receptor. Signal transduction ends with regulation of a downstream cellular process, e.g. regulation of transcription or regulation of a metabolic process. Signal transduction covers signaling from receptors located on the surface of the cell and signaling via molecules located within the cell. For signaling between cells, signal transduction is restricted to events at and within the receiving cell." [GOC:go_curators, GOC:mtg_signaling_feb11] \\

GO:BP & GO:0023052 & signaling & 0.000000 & "The entirety of a process in which information is transmitted within a biological system. This process begins with an active signal and ends when a cellular response has been triggered." [GOC:mtg_signal, GOC:mtg_signaling_feb11, GOC:signaling] \\
